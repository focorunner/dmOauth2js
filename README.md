dmOauth2js
==========

this is a simple oAuth 2 flow example flow for the Dailymile.com API. My original intent was to use this to authenticate and design an application to download your workout data and provide more detailed analystics than those available on Dailymile about your workouts and performance...

That was before I got a day job, and ran out of time and interest to pursue this. 

I haven't tested this recently (probably since the date of the previous commit or so), so if Dailymile has changed their authentication flow, this may no longer work. Use if/as you wish.
